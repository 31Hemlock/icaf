            Our efforts to democratize creativity and develop empathy are essential because creativity fuels capitalism
            and mutual empathy makes democracy workable.
            <br><br>
            We employ the power of the arts for children&#8217;s creative and empathic development because conceptually
            both
            creativity and empathy are rooted in the arts—a universal language, native to children.
            <br><br>
            Despite growing up in a bitterly divided world that restlessly faces the Fourth Industrial Revolution, our
            children can forge a prosperous, sustainable, and peaceful future with creative minds and empathic hearts.

                producing original works under the Arts Olympiad and other ICAF programs. An estimated 2,500,000
                individuals have participated in or attended ICAFs festivals and exhibitions that have taken place in
                over a dozen major cities worldwide. This number includes the audiences who have attended ICAF&#8217;s
                special
                events such as conferences and symposia. Nearly one million children, parents, teachers and librarians
                comprise the total readership since 1998 of ICAF&#8217;s ChildArt magazine, published on a quarterly
                basis. On
                a daily basis, a few thousand children worldwide learn about the ICAF from their peers or online,
                gaining confidence in themselves as creators (not merely pupils or consumers, recognizing that their
                imagination is seedbed for discovery and innovation, and telling themselves that their art is the most
                honest and purest form of human creative expression.</div>
