            Declining creativity and rising obesity are two acute crises our children face today. 
            Research shows that while 98% of 5-year-olds exhibit divergent creative thinking, 
            this number plummets to 2% by age 25. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
            report that obesity prevalence has reached 20%, affecting some 15 million children.
            <br>
            <br>
            Similar to a lack of creativity, obesity is easy to recognize but difficult to treat using 
            conventional means. The Arts Olympiad, our school art program, employs the arts as a 
            dynamic physical activity to get to one of the causes of declining creativity and 
            rising obesity: How children view themselves. The Arts Olympiad introduces them to the 
            "Artist-Athlete Ideal" of the creative mind and healthy body (mente sana in corpo sano). 
            This new identity can awaken the dormant "inner artist" or the slumbering "inner athlete." 
            Students realize that mind and body reflect each other because one's state of mind can 
            have an epigenetic effect. Students depict themselves as "artist-athletes" in their 
            paintings or drawings, solidifying their revised self-image. They come to understand 
            themselves and each other through their art. Their school transforms into an artistic and healthy, integrated community.
            <br>
            <br>
            The most imaginative artist-athletes, selected through 
            school art contests, convene at the National Mall across the U.S. Capitol for three days 
            at their World Children’s Festival. The workshops, activities, and training at the festival 
            make it a transformative experience that infuses creativity with empathy, inspiring children
            to become "creative-empaths" who are eager and prepared to work together to benefit the 
            nation and the world.
            <br>
