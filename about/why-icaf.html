        <div class="sections1">To democratize creativity for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and develop mutual empathy
            for a “more perfect union.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Incorporated in 1997 in the District of Columbia as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, ICAF serves American children as
            their national arts organization that cultivates their creativity and grows empathy among them and their
            peers worldwide through the universal language of art.
            <br>
            <br>
            ICAF focuses on 8- to 12-year-olds because they often suffer the consequences of the well-documented
            "fourth-grade slump" in their creativity and are subject to surroundings (real or virtual) that can muddy
            their "mirror neurons" responsible for empathy.

        <!-- section2 -->
        <div class="section-titles">Intervention</div>
        <div class="sections2">
            ICAF publishes ChildArt quarterly to grow imagination, organizes the Arts Olympiad to
            foster creative development, and produces the World Children's Festival to develop mutual empathy.
            <br><br>
            ICAF arranges interactive exhibitions to kindle the inner child of professionals. But children are at the
            heart of what ICAF does. The ICAF Healing Art Program revives faith in nature of child victims of natural
            disasters, and the Peace through Art Program restores trust in humanity of children living in conflict
            zones.
            <br><br>
            ICAF has pioneered STEAMS education to integrate the Arts (creative activities) and Sports (physical
            activities) with STEM disciplines for children's holistic development. The United States Olympic Committee
            has granted ICAF an exclusive license to use the "Arts Olympiad" mark.

        <!-- section3 -->
        <div class="section-titles">Vision</div>

        <div class="sections2">
            ICAF is in the business of producing "Creative-Empaths"—a sterling human character and
            quality which reflects that of America's Founding Fathers. ICAF plants the seeds of freedom by preserving
            and fostering children's innate creativity and intrinsic empathy. ICAF inspires children to boldly step
            beyond the boundaries set before them by envisioning a brave new world where diversity and differences
            enhance the fractal of human discovery and evolution. ICAF lays the building blocks for American cultural,
            economic, and social prosperity by inspiring, empowering, and meaningfully connecting our children as
            change-makers who can shape a more prosperous and peaceful future.
