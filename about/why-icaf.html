            <div class="section-title">Why Creativity</div>
            <div class="section">Creativity is the calling to emulate the Creator by enhancing Earth's beauty or
                bringing joy or comfort
                to others. What you create can grow like a rosewood tree or be as fleeting as a rose.
                <br>
                <br>
                Creative individuals have an unquenchable curiosity and a sense of wonder. They create their own
                pathways and structures, unafraid of ambiguity or uncertainty.
                <br>
                <br>
                But American creativity is declining. Researchers have found that 98% of 5-year-olds but only 2% of
                25-year-olds exhibit divergent creative thinking.
                <br>
                <br>
                One major roadblock in human development is the "fourth-grade slump" in creativity discovered by E.
                Paul Torrance, widely regarded as the "father" of creativity. Schoolchildren must overcome the
                "fourth-grade slump" to grow a nation of creators.
            </div>
            <div class="section-title">Why Empathy</div>
            <div class="section">Empathy is the calling to love thy enemy. Empathy is the ability to stand in the shoes
                of those one
                despises to experience their feelings, cognitively and emotionally.
                <br>
                <br>
                Every child is born into a tribe. He comes to believe in the morality and authenticity of its narrative.
                Through his family's heritage and customs, he learns where he comes from and where he belongs.
                He develops a fellow feeling or "parochial" empathy for his tribe. Neuroscientists have found that the
                stronger the parochial empathy, the deeper the fear of or hatred for outsiders and outgroups.
                <br>
                <br>
                &ldquo;If we are to teach real peace in this world, and if we are to carry on a real war against war, we
                shall
                have to begin with the children.&rdquo; &ndash; Mahatma Gandhi.
            </div>
            <div class="section-title">Why the Arts</div>
            <div class="section">
                Creativity and arts deliver the empathy needed for a brave new world where the value of our
                meaningful differences continues to expand the fractal of human discovery and evolution.
                <br>
                <br>
                The 2021 report Art for Life's Sake: The Case for Arts Education of the American Academy of Arts &amp;
                Sciences provides "evidence of the attributes, values, and skills that come from arts education,
                including social and emotional development, improvements in school engagement, as well as vital
                civic and social participation."
                <br>
                <br>
                &ldquo;Through art alone are we able to emerge from ourselves to know what another person<br>
                sees.&rdquo; &ndash; Marcel Proust.

            <div class="section-title">Why ICAF's Intervention</div>
            <div class="section">
                So dire are the world's crises today that the very future of the species is at stake. Our children can
                save us, but they need guidance and support.
                <br><br>
                1) Declining creativity and rising obesity are critical problems that children face. The Arts Olympiad,
                ICAF's school art program, empowers 8- to 12-year-olds to overcome the "fourth-grade slump" in their
                creativity by kindling the "inner artist" that may lay dormant.
                <br><br>
                Creativity can level the playing field for disadvantaged schoolchildren (in low-income Title 1 schools)
                because it empowers them to blaze new trails that break the vicious cycle of intergenerational
                poverty.
                <br><br>
                As the Fifth Industrial Revolution unrolls (AI becomes sentient, robots conduct office work, and cobots
                control the factory floor), creativity must be democratized as the survival skill of workers and
                professionals.
                <br><br>
                The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that 20% of American children and
                adolescents are already obese today. The American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry
                explains that obesity is among the easiest medical conditions to recognize but most difficult to treat
                through conventional means that do not engage and empower schoolchildren. The Arts Olympiad
                kindles the slumbering "inner athletes" to motivate students to engage in physical activities.
                <br><br>
                2) The caste culture the educational system bolsters by ranking elite universities at the top, and
                public-school dropouts at the bottom, do not auger well for "a more perfect union."
                <br><br>
                According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about 25% of U.S. schools are private, with
                nearly 10% of PK-12 students enrolled. As many as 78% of the 6 million private school students
                attend religious schools, and enrollment in conservative Christian, Jewish, and Islamic schools has
                risen recently. Religious education may prepare patrons and guardians of the faith with an outpouring
                of parochial empathy for co-religionists but little so, if any, for outsiders or outgroups.
                <br><br>
                The World Children's Festival brings together students from religious, secular, and nonsectarian
                private schools, also those homeschooled, to interact with students from low-income (Title 1) schools.
                They come to know each other and realize they share more in common than their differences.
                Collaborative mural-making makes them co-imagine and cooperate, and learn from each other. The
                festival's transformative experience develops the mutual empathy necessary for conflict resolution,
                social justice, and communal harmony.
                <br><br>
                Creativity is a supreme human attribute, and empathy is its apex. Not from telling children what to
                think but how to think, ICAF inspires them to boldly step beyond the boundaries set before them and
                challenge the norm.
                <br><br>
                ICAF's programs are free-of-charge, festivals free and open to the public, and ChildArt magazine is
                free of commercial advertisements. That's why ICAF depends upon your generosity.
